# ft_printf
ft_printf is a kind of simplified recreation of the original printf function, which includes many, but not all, parses that the original function does when using variadic arguments. It uses the libft library which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Alexgar98/Libft">here</a>, it just needs to be copied into a folder called "libft" to allow everything to compile. You can find the subject <a href="https://github.com/rphlr/42-Subjects/blob/main/common-core/ft_printf/en.subject.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Things to improve:</h3>
This is an overly complicated code which uses mallocs when they're not actually needed to successfully pass this project (didn't need them at all to pass Exam 03). Might as well try the bonus part in a distant future.
